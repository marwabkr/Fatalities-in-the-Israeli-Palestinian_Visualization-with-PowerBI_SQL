# Fatalities in the Israeli and Palestinian Conflict

This project aims to analyze and visualize data on fatalities in the Israeli and Palestinian conflict using various tools and techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [fatalities_isr_pse_conflict_2000_to_2023.csv], and the analysis is performed using tools  SQL, and visualization tools Power bi.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project provides information on fatalities in the Israeli and Palestinian conflict over a specified time period. It includes details such as date, location, age, gender, and other relevant attributes of each recorded fatality. The dataset is available at [insert dataset link].

## Tools Used

The project utilizes the following tools and technologies:
- SQL: SQL queries are employed for data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks.
- Power BI: Power BI is used for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards and reports.

## Analysis Process

The analysis process consists of the following steps:

1. Data Extraction: The dataset is acquired from [fatalities_isr_pse_conflict_2000_to_2023.csv] and imported into a suitable database management system.
2. Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis. Missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies are handled during this stage.
3. Data Analysis: SQL queries are utilized to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. Various analytical techniques can be applied to explore patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
4. Visualization: Tableau is employed to create interactive visualizations, charts, and dashboards to effectively communicate the findings of the analysis.
5. Interpretation: The results and visualizations are interpreted to gain a better understanding of the fatalities in the Israeli and Palestinian conflict and identify key patterns or insights.

## Usage
